Tool to shrink VPK and install the rest via FTP (Still WIP)

ncftp is required to use this script.

yad (zenity drop-in replacement) is used by default but the references can also be replaced with zenity and it should work.

For now launch from a terminal window (Haven't figured out a way to get the stdout displayed in yad in real time)
